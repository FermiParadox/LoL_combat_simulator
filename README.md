### What's this ###
This is a program ("MyLoLCalc2" for short) intended to calculate the damage output (along with other metrics) of any setup for League of Legends (a popular MMO game). 

###  What's League of Legends ###
In League of Legends ("LoL" for short), the player can choose among many different items, runes, masteries, abilities, and use-order of spells and is matched against other players with the same options. All those options allow a vast amount of possible setups, called "builds". 

### Does it work ###
Yes, however it's not complete. And also it's outdated. LoL changes very often. There are probably many more bugs to fix, but it's functional and for given builds it produces exactly the expected results. 
You can check the `results_example.png` to get an idea of some of the results. Note that this output was purely for testing. Nearly no front-end development took place.

### Dog ate your unit tests? ###
MyLoLCalc**2** was practically my first program created on Python (actually it's my first program on *any* language). Its first version MyLoLCalc**1** was abandoned very early since there were some fundamental bugs. 
I'm not a professional programmer and this project was not my full time job. However it got to a functional state, it was maintainable (perhaps excluding portions of "factory" module which I'd rather rewrite than refactor) and preliminary timing testing indicated that it _might_ have been fast enough for production (might be wrong on that). 


### How to run it ###
Works on python 3.4 and 3.5 (though i haven't tested 3.5 for additional bugs), 

On Ubuntu, try to run `functional_testing/full_tests.py`, and the errors for missing dependencies along with a couple of easy searches should be enough to help you install whatever is missing.

Assuming all dependencies are installed, run  `functional_testing/full_tests.py` and you'll get an image similar to `results_example.png` along with test results regarding results' consistency and time profiling. Modify `functional_testing/default_config.py` to test other builds.


### Current state ###
The whole project was abandoned due to third parties involved.
