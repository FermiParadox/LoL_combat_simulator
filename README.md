# MyLoLCalc2
It calculates the damage output (along with other metrics) of any setup for League of Legends. 

###  What's League of Legends 
"LoL" for short, is a popular game. The player can choose among hundreds of items, runes, masteries, 
abilities, and use-order of spells and is matched against other players with the same options. 
All those options allow a vast amount of possible setups, called "builds". 

### Does it work 
**Yes.** It's functional and for given builds it produces 
exactly the expected results. **But it's incomplete and outdated**. 

Check `results_example.png` to see some of the results. 
Note that this output was purely for testing. 
Nearly no front-end development took place.

### How to run it
Works on python 3.8 (excluding Kivy).

Install dependencies and run  `functional_testing/full_tests.py` and you'll get an image 
similar to `results_example.png`. Modify `functional_testing/default_config.py` to test other builds.


### Current state
The whole project was abandoned due to external issues. 


### No unit tests?
MyLoLCalc**2** was practically my 1st program created on Python (actually it's my 1st program on *any* language). 
Its 1st version MyLoLCalc**1** was abandoned very early since there were some fundamental bugs. 
I'm not a professional programmer and this project was not my full time job. However, it got to a functional state, 
it was maintainable (perhaps excluding portions of "factory" module which I'd rather rewrite than refactor).
