# What's this #

It's a GUI written in python with kivy. It requires a server containing the LoL-calc in order to be fully functional.  

# Why it was created #

This GUI was created so that testers can have remote access to the actual calculator, without the need to install the calc itself. 

# It's abandoned #
It was abandoned along with the calc.    
Check the [calc's README](https://bitbucket.org/Smith_Anderson/lol-calc/overview) for more details.
